# Bank-analysis 
Project Title: UCI Bank Marketing Data Analysis


This project explores the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior and trends. Using Python and key libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to answer specific business questions. The findings can help improve marketing strategies, understand customer demographics, and identify patterns for better decision-making.

Key Questions Analyzed
1. How many married individuals are unemployed?
2. What is the average age of individuals who subscribed to a term deposit versus those who did not?
3. How does the average balance vary across different contact months?
4. How does the average duration of customer calls vary by month?
5. What is the distribution of marital status (married/single/divorced) across different education levels?
6. how many Marital_statuts have housing

We analyzed the employment status of married individuals, specifically identifying those with an 'unknown' job type. A pie chart was created to illustrate the proportion of unemployed individuals within the married population."
